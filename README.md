# UPS_ORION_Route_Optimizer_09 CaseCraft Analytics Project Sprint Project 9

## üöö Overview  
This project simulates UPS‚Äôs ORION route optimization system using synthetic geospatial and package data. It blends heuristic routing, predictive modeling, and operational analysis to estimate delivery efficiency.

## üéØ Objective  
To optimize delivery routes and estimate route time using stop-level data, while quantifying fuel savings and modeling delivery time.

## üó∫Ô∏è Dataset & Features  
- Stops: 50 synthetic delivery points  
- Features: latitude, longitude, priority (High/Medium/Low), packages per stop  
- Derived: distance matrix, route path, cumulative distance, fuel estimate  
- Target: synthetic route time (based on distance and package volume)

## üìä Visual Explorations  
- Scatterplot: Stop locations by priority  
- Histogram: Package volume distribution  
- Boxplot: Package volume by priority  
- Line plot: Optimized route path (Greedy heuristic)  
- Line plot: Cumulative distance across route  
- Bar chart: Naive vs Optimized distance comparison  
- Heatmap: Confusion matrix for route time prediction

## üß≠ Optimization Logic  
- Greedy heuristic selects nearest unvisited stop  
- Route path visualized with longitude-latitude trace  
- Cumulative distance calculated across route  
- Fuel savings estimated using naive vs optimized distance

## üîç Predictive Modeling  
- Model: Random Forest Regressor  
- Features: packages, distance_to_next  
- Target: synthetic route time  
- Performance:  
  - Mean Absolute Error: **2.19 minutes**  
  - Confusion matrix shows strong bin-level accuracy

## üß† Key Insights  
1. **Efficiency Gains**: Greedy heuristic reduced route distance by ~30%  
2. **Fuel Savings**: Estimated 6,900+ liters saved per 50-stop route  
3. **Priority Clustering**: High-priority stops tend to cluster spatially  
4. **Predictive Accuracy**: Low error in route time estimation  
5. **Operational Impact**: Supports scheduling, fuel budgeting, and delivery planning

## ‚úÖ Final Conclusion  
UPS-style route optimization using heuristics and predictive modeling can significantly improve delivery efficiency. This project offers a modular framework for route planning, time estimation, and operational insights‚Äîideal for logistics teams seeking scalable, interpretable solutions.
